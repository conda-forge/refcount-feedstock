  summary: A Python package for reference counting and interop with native pointers
  description: |
    This package helps you achieve reliable management of memory 
    allocated in native libraries, written for instance in C++. While 
    it boils down to "simply" maintaining a set of counters, 
    it is deceptively complicated to do so properly and not end up 
    with memory leaks or crashes.
